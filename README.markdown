# English Narrative Report for GenoPro

Description from [pinned forum post][narrative]:

This skin is an update to the version built-in to GenoPro, correcting
a number of bugs and adding many more new features.  Note that the
version within GenoPro is not replaced and this one sits alongside it.
It is necessary to choose the correct skin when generating a report.

Essentially this report skin is used to generate a multi page HTML
report providing comprehensive indexed documentation of your family
tree, including timelines and ancestor pedigree charts. GenoPro's
GenoMaps are represented by interactive SVG images that can be zoomed
and panned. The report can be published to the GenoPro 'familytrees' web
site, to your own web site or to your hard drive or other local storage.

It can also be used to produce a 'book' style report in PDF format.
